	Project Name: ETH/USDT Transactions Analytics

	> Todo: Processor has to merge orders with similar day-hour-minute. The seeconds can be ignored.
			> So processor has to send out a DTO for every minute
			> Use DateTimeFormatter to omit seconds OR Create a new LocalDateTime using the
			  method that doesn't take seconds... Before writing to Kafka using it as KEY.
				
    > FRONTEND:
     -- Two time-series bar charts, one for sells(red) and the other for buys(green)
     -- (Quantity vs Time Scale Of Seconds)

	> Stream Processor: For every minute create a data structure that has aggregate quantity for sell and buy.

	Modules:
		* data-extractor
		* dasboard.
		* stream-processor
		* common - [DTOs, Kafka Serdes, etc] (Copy common module from COVID-19 project)

	Data transfer from Kafka OUTPUT_TOPIC to Dashboard UI has to be synchronous. The Output topic should only be polled when a request
	Comes in from the frontend. Use JS schedule functionality to call an API endpoint every 25 seconds. The API request should then trigger
    a poll  of the KAfka OUTPUT_TOPIC afterwards a data packet is returned. DO NOT USE ANY KIND OF SCHEDULED POLLING TO GET KAFKA DATA.
